# NetworkDuplicates
Extends the Developer Tools, adding duplicate network calls detection.

Features:

1. list of duplicate network calls, sorted by number of times a resource was called.
2. list of resources with the same name, which were called from different urls.
3. a side-panel in the sources tab, showing nested iframes which could lead to duplicate network calls.
